EntityFramework
1. Relationships
   a. one to many: one user have many photos
   b. After migration, 
      EF add extra column to Photo: AppUserId (with nullable = true!!!)
      and onDelete: Reference restriction!
   c. remove the migration first:
      >dotnet ef migrations remove
   d. Add 2 extra column to Photo class: Fully defining the relation between Photo and AppUser
      public AppUser AppUser { get; set; }
      public int AppUserId { get; set; }
   e. Run add migrations again:
      >dotnet ef migrations add ExtendedUserEntity
      >dotnet ef database update

2. Conventions
3. Seeding Data into the db
4. The repository pattern
5. Using AutoMapper
